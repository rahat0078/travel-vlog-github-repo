        <h3><i>Cox's Bazar Tour</i></h3>

        <p> It was my first visit to the Cox's Bazaar i was so excited and it was not holidays so i have had the best view of the sea. As all the other points were crowded we choose Laboni Point to spend our time. The sea was calm and we stayed more than 3 hours there. The view of that place will make you spell bound. We had enjoyed sunset from the sea and it was the best part of my journey. <button>Read more</button>  <br>

        <h3><i>Sylhet Tour</i></h3>
        <p> Sylhet is the tea capital, a prime attraction for all tourists visiting Bangladesh. Lies between the Khasia and the Jaintia hills on the north, and the Tripura hills on the south. Sylhet breaks the monotony of the flatness of this land with a multitude of terraced tea gardens, rolling countryside, and exotic flora and fauna. This is home to the largest Shrines in the region, a land of vibrant cultures from tribal & local people. Its natural resources like a rainforest, swamp forest, wetlands, waterfalls, Tamabil, Jaflong, Lalakhal, and the Bichanakandi-connected to Meghalaya by the river are most interesting to visit.   <button>Read more</button>  </p>
